## Linux Audio Setup

### JACK, Alsa, pulse, pipewire?

Pipewire is the newer kid on the block, trying to abstract/subsume the others afaiu. Newest (2024 bookwork) Debian ships this. People say it starts to be usable in realtime-ish applications.

I had problems with SonicPI and bluetooth headphones. Need `qpwgraph` to manually connect the out from SonicPI to the bluetooth headphone if I want to use them.

## MIDI


## Plugins
